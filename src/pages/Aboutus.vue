            <p>David Roney is a challenger. He hopes that his students develop as critically conscious, radically empathetic readers, writers, and thinkers with the courage to challenge injustice when they encounter it. David was excited to settle down in San Diego after growing up in Arizona, attending Wofford College in South Carolina, and teaching for five years in Tennessee. He is passionate about this project because he believes that by telling our stories, we can build authentic community and by localizing food production we can heal the earth. It is the first time he has published a book with his students. </p>

            <p>Kyle Linnik is a maker. He organized and guided his students as they built the farm. He showed us how to 3D modeling, dig, and level the ground. Kyle was a part of the founding faculty of High Tech High Chula Vista and has moved to high tech high mesa. He has already done amazing projects, and creating this farm has been one of the most ambitious. He had made a farm once before with a group of 7th graders over the span of a year but this project is over the semester. </p>
