                      <p>
                        Building a planter box is simple, but you need to follow a series of steps. First, you need to gather materials. The tools that are needed are a drill, miter saw, screws, washers, wood. Next, you need to size and cut your wood. Cut the wood down to the size you have available at your plot. For our boxes, the length of the wood was twelve feet on two sides and ten feet on two sides. The planks are ten inches wide. Two planks are twelve feet and two planks are ten feet. To assemble the corners, measure and mark the length of the corner posts and cut the posts. They should be the height of the garden bed wall when buried in holes, in order to make them more structurally sound. Put posts into position in the holes and refill the holes with dirt. In each corner of the shorter boards, drill a pilot hole. Then put a driving bit on the drill to screw and adjoin the corners. Repeat until all sides are joined. When the box is assembled, sand off any rough edges. Next, place the planter box at the desired location. Fill with the appropriate type of soil needed for your plants. Fill the box 3/4 full with soil. The box is now ready for use.

                      <p>
                        The science behind planter beds and outdoor learning centers are quite interesting. You can find science and physics behind growing the soil, composting. Behind making a garden is physics like its habitat, the engineering of the making of each project. Like the making of our planter beds and learning center. Physics can be shown in the tools we use while working as well. As we were building the planter beds we can see the science behind the actual building, cutting of wood, and much more. We have to use pressure and sharp tools that heat up the wood. This is an example of a chemical reaction because we are heating the wood and cutting it.

                      <p>
                        The chicken coop group project was to create a chicken coop. We first started by researching what chickens need. We learned chickens need two to three square feet. Then we looked at possible chicken coops designs until we decided on one. Then we created a similar 3D model on Sketch Up. We then dug holes so we could sink the wooden beams into the ground. Next, we put wood pieces attaching all six poles. After this, one of the group members' dad helped us get the rest of the materials we needed since he's a construction worker. He even got a few of his co-workers to come out and help us build the coop. We then began to work on it ourselves. We put on a shelf for the chickens as well as shingles for the roof, and a top for the storage. Next, we would’ve had to put in the dividers for hens laying space and chicken coop wire around the house so that we could keep them enclosed and protected in their space. We haven’t finished it but, all we would’ve had to do was build a door to get in and out of the chicken coop, add the chicken wire around the chicken coop, and finish the inside of the coop house. Our next step was to get and take care of our chickens. We sadly didn’t get to this step but it would have required us getting feed and bedding for the chickens. Every day we would have needed to check on the chickens and make sure they have clean food and water. As well as retrieve the eggs from their nesting boxes. Around once a month you’ll need to clean and scrape the chicken poop. Of course, there are more things but these are the main parts to taking care of chickens.

                      <p>
                        You may not think chickens have that much Physics to them but you’re wrong. Even just looking at the chicken shell there is already so much physics to it. For example here is a little experiment. Get an egg and try to crack it with your hand by putting pressure only on the top and the bottom. Either you're incredibly strong or cheated but you shouldn’t have been able to crack the egg. It’s because of the shape of the egg. It had a 3-dimensional arch making it extremely strong which is incredible.

                      <p>
                        Our group was in charge of making the compost and vermicompost bins. If you don’t already know composting is essentially the process of food decay rotting and getting decomposed (or broken down) to eventually become part of plant-soil or to be used in other helpful ways. Compost is particularly awesome because it is packed full of nutrients and is essentially reusing the dead or unwanted scraps, it’s also just a great bid food fest to tons of little creatures. The steps of making these things took time and patience. Our first step was brainstorming how we wanted our compost and vermicompost bin to look. We went through so many ideas just to come up with a basic but very good working idea. Our second step was taking that idea and inputting it into Sketch Up. Sketch Up is an app that you can use to visualize and get a feel for how your project will turn out along with what the measurements will be. Our third step was gathering materials and seeing what things worked and what things didn’t. After we figured that out it was time to start digging the post holes. Let me just say this was the hardest part of the whole thing. We had to re-dig the post holes and move them around so many times, and to be honest they are still not perfect! Next, we positioned the posts and started barring them down so they would be nice and secure. Then we started to drill the backboards and the wood palettes on to the posts to create the actual structure for the compost bed system. Finally, we add in some greens and browns to our compost (“greens and browns”) wait a few weeks, flip a few times, water that pile (but be careful not to overwater!) and BAM! We got some compost! Putting everything together took a lot of time and hard work, but was worth it in the end.

                      <h2 class="subtitle has-text-black">The Physics</h2>
                      <p>
                        In general, the compost does not have as many physical elements as other products, the compost is related to physics through heat, the ratio, and the destruction of food. Temperature is the most important thing, this determines if the compost is going to work or not and makes it effective. For a compost to work it has to have a certain temperature to start decomposing, “When the battery is heated to 60 to 70 degrees F, mesophilic bacteria are responsible for much of the decomposition.”.

                        But what is needed to reach that temperature? Two important components are needed and a step that is essential in composting:

                        “Moisture: Organisms in biodegradation require water to survive, the water content helps control temperature, and too much water means there is not enough oxygen.”
                        “Nutrients:This Dramatically alters the time it takes to decompose. Decomposers require different levels of these nutrients to survive, thrive, and decompose”
                        Size of the pile and turn the pile


                        But how is heat produced? “Heat is produced as a by-product of the microbial decomposition of organic material.” Heat helps destroy seeds and potential weeds. When adequate heat is ensured, compost is made easier.for example, in the compost you make those organic materials that help heat increase, but not to a maximum amount, it increases exactly what the compost needs. This certain temperature is needed, neither so hot nor so cold

                      <p>
                        For our project, we built a wood-fired oven. First, we used a yoga ball and cut a hole slightly smaller than it in a wooden board and fit the board into it. Then we used tape to attach half of a metal barrel to the ball and covered the whole thing with tape. We left enough room for a yogurt cup for an exhaust pipe. We made a mixture of cement, per tile, and water for the actual form of the dome. We completely covered it in the mixture and let it dry for a few days until the cast is complete and ready. Next is to deflate the ball and remove the tape from the inside as the cast has now dried. The table our oven will be on will be made of various wooden panels and planks. Lay down fire bricks on the table and make sure there are as small of gaps as possible. Put the cast on top of the bricks and cover the dome completely in fire blanket material and then cover that in chicken wire. Then add on another layer of the mixture from earlier on top of the fire blanket and chicken wire and wait a few days to dry. Make a fire and start small, work your way up to a big fire, make modifications, and add things if needed. You now have your firewood oven!

                      <p>
                        The main physical property of a wood-fired oven is conduction. The fire bricks used to line the interior of the oven hold around half a ton of thermal mass. This means it gets extremely hot and cooks quickly. The dome shape of the oven can transfer heat evenly through the pizza. It also allows less air to circulate creating a sort of oven in an oven, this is the conductive property of the oven. As the heat begins to transfer into the pizza through the bricks the molecules in the pizza begin to move which cooks it. Moreover, because this type of oven can get higher than the boiling point of water it evaporates the moisture in the pizza crust giving it a nice dry crust and evenly caramelized toppings.

                      <p>
                        For our project, Irrigation and Electrical we were going to be putting up lights and doing the piping for the farm beds. Just as we were finishing up the beds we had to stop because of the health concerns. We started by trenching a hole from one side of the one-hundred-fifty foot dirt patch to the other. This is something that the entire class worked on, and it took weeks. Once we were finally done with this we were able to lay down the pipes and put them all together, although on our first attempt we thought we were finished but we glued into the wrong main pipe so we had to go back and cut into a different pipe (which was actually a lot of fun because the pipe was still active and very much on so we got a water park during the middle of a school day). Next up was electrical, which we had some big plans that we just never got to, like building a little pergola on some school land. We were going to hang lights onto it and it was going to be powered either by batteries that we would recharge by bringing back in the school or, the other option was trying to get solar panels which we hadn’t got to, but there were some preliminary plans. Although we didn’t get the solar panels out there we did get a wind turbine moved out to the field. It wasn’t anything powerful enough to use for the lights but may be powerful enough to charge a few phones out at the field. In the end, we had some big plans but also a lot of challenges.

                      <p>
                        Our team's product, the Irrigation and Electrical systems of our Farm to Mesa outdoor kitchen. We were doing both water piping and, although we didn’t get to this we were going to do lighting; these two things seem very different but are actually very connected once we break them down. As shown on thespruce.com and windows2universe.org, the way that electricity moves is very similar to the way water moves. Water moves because of pressure, gravity, or siphoning. Electricity moves because of the flow of electrons. A battery and a water pump serve the same purpose, as well as a wire and a pipe are equivalents for electricity or water. Another similarity is the blockage in a water pipe and a resistor for electricity. One of our goals was to try to get renewable energy sources out to the farm, we were able to move the windmill out to the farm but struggled to properly fix it. We wanted to get solar panels out to the farm as well, a little ambitious? Yes, but it was a possibility. Another option was to charge the same batteries that we would’ve used with the solar panels and charge those inside the school, either way, we would’ve had a really, lit farm. I mean really, it would’ve been pipin’ hot. So our group did have a few problems along the line but in the end, we ended up with something that was definitely on the right path.

                      <p>
                        Our project was the smoker/grill to represent a radiant cooker. A radiant cooker uses radiation; a heat transfer method to cook food. Our first step was to research and create a design plan to build our smoker. After researching many different websites and videos, we finally decided to go with a horizontal offset smoker. This smoker has a horizontal cooking chamber, with a firebox on the side of the cooking chamber that allows smoke to run through it. We came up with a design on Google SketchUp and got to work. After we got our resources which were two 55 gallon barrels and metal square rods, we cut the two barrels in half. We started angle grinding the paint off of the barrels so we could weld the hinges on those parts. Once we finished grinding the parts, we welded the hinges onto the barrels to make the cooking chamber. Then we cut the metal rods to make legs as a stand for our smoker. We were then going to cut a hole in our cooking chamber to let the smoke from our firebox flow through. After that, we planned to weld our firebox onto the side of our cooking chamber and we would have our smoker. Finally, we would make a smokestack and attach it to our cooking chamber to let the smoke get out. The purpose of our smoker/grill is not only to cook food but also to allow us to watch heat transfer in action.

                      <p>
                        There are 3 types of heat transfer, conduction, convection, and radiation. The method of heat transfer which is used in our project is radiation. Radiation does not rely on contact to transfer heat like conduction and convection. Radiation uses infrared light which has longer wavelengths than regular light to transfer energy. An example of radiation is your microwave or the sun. Our project uses mostly radiation. The infrared light from our fire and fuel is the main way that the food is cooked. But the smoke (which uses the method of convection for heat transfer) also cooks the food through convection (through the air) and the metal plates heat the food through conduction (touch), which allows for a more evenly cooked meal in shorter cook time.
